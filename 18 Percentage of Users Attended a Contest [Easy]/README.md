## [SQL50] 18. Percentage of Users Attended a Contest
[Percentage of Users Attended a Contest](https://leetcode.com/problems/percentage-of-users-attended-a-contest/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

Table: `Users`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| user_name   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a user.
```

Table: `Register`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| contest_id  | int     |
| user_id     | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(contest_id, user_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id of a user and the contest they registered into.
```

Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to **two decimals**.

Return the result table ordered by `percentage` in **descending order**. In case of a tie, order it by `contest_id` in **ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

```
Example 1:

Input: 
Users table:
+---------+-----------+
| user_id | user_name |
+---------+-----------+
| 6       | Alice     |
| 2       | Bob       |
| 7       | Alex      |
+---------+-----------+
Register table:
+------------+---------+
| contest_id | user_id |
+------------+---------+
| 215        | 6       |
| 209        | 2       |
| 208        | 2       |
| 210        | 6       |
| 208        | 6       |
| 209        | 7       |
| 209        | 6       |
| 215        | 7       |
| 208        | 7       |
| 210        | 2       |
| 207        | 2       |
| 210        | 7       |
+------------+---------+
Output: 
+------------+------------+
| contest_id | percentage |
+------------+------------+
| 208        | 100.0      |
| 209        | 100.0      |
| 210        | 100.0      |
| 215        | 66.67      |
| 207        | 33.33      |
+------------+------------+
Explanation: 
All the users registered in contests 208, 209, and 210. The percentage is 100% and we sort them in the answer table by contest_id in ascending order.
Alice and Alex registered in contest 215 and the percentage is ((2/3) * 100) = 66.67%
Bob registered in contest 207 and the percentage is ((1/3) * 100) = 33.33%
```

### Solution: 

```sql
SELECT
    contest_id, ROUND(COUNT(contest_id)/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM Users) * 100, 2) AS percentage
FROM 
    Register r
GROUP BY
    contest_id
ORDER BY
    percentage DESC, contest_id;
```

### Breakdown of Solution:

1. The trickest part would be that inner SELECT statement.

percentage = numerator(count) / denominator(population)

**denominator**
* in our example 1, the number of users are 3. To obtain the percentage, we need to extract this information from `Users` table.
* Inner SELECT statement, `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM Users` is ther for that

**numerator**
* numerator information, `count` is obtained by `GROUP BY` and `COUNT` functions.

2. Others

- Other parts of this problem is tangential: rounding, ordering, renaming a column etc.
